# Overview and Objectives
This project integrates drone technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to detect
diseases in tomato and pepper crops. The primary goal is to enhance agricultural
practices by providing early, accurate detection of diseases through high-resolution
drone imagery, processed using advanced AI algorithms. By leveraging dronebased
data collection and AI-based analysis, we aim to assist farmers in identifying
crop diseases early, ultimately contributing to increased yields and food security
